Notes I took during the R course on the Google Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera, regarding the processing and analysis of data using the Tidyverse packages.
Notes doesnÂ´t include the course introduction, where basic concepts are explained, such as working with functions, creating variables, vectors and data frames, working through pipes and installing and loading packages or libraries.
